        <p> This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may <em>look</em>  happy, but he's a <em>little</em> disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.
        </p>
        <p>Jack would really like...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
            <li>A Motorized Lego set</li>
        </ul>
        <p> You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="toysrus.com">toysrus.com</a>  and <a href="e-toys.com">eToys</a>.
